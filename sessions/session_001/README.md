# Calico Live
In this session, we explored the fundamentals of container networking and Kubernetes. We started by examining namespaces, cgroups, and the filesystem, which are the building blocks of Linux containerized applications. Then, we delved into the process of installing and deploying networking on a Kubernetes cluster.

Throughout the session, we gained a deeper understanding of how container networking works and how it integrates with Kubernetes. We learned about namespaces, cgroups, and the filesystem, which serve as crucial components for containerization, enabling the isolation and resource management of containerized processes.

Moving forward, we focused on the installation and deployment of networking within a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes, being an open-source container orchestration platform, simplifies the management and scaling of containerized applications. By deploying networking components in a Kubernetes cluster, we establish seamless communication between containers and external resources.

By the end of the session, we had acquired a comprehensive understanding of container networking fundamentals and their integration with Kubernetes. We were equipped with the knowledge and skills required to effectively manage networking in containerized applications within a Kubernetes cluster.
